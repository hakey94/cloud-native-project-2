1. Web client:
- I was chosen REST API because it is the most common for message passing and it gives a relatively high throughput in API performance.
2. Mobile devices:
- I was chosen gRPC to collect the large volumn of location from mobile devices.
And gRPC is particularly well-suited for microservices architectures, real-time applications.
The performance of gRPC is really good. This can result in lower latency and higher thoughput for 
communication between services.
3. Message Queues (Kafka)
- I was chosen Kafka to handle the ingested location data because it is a durable distributed Queue
that can handle large volumes of data. While the application need to collect a large location data from mobile devices
